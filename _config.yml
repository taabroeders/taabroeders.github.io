  Hi, my name is Tommy and I'm a postdoctoral student at the department of Anatomy and Neurosciences (Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc). My research uses <mark>computational neuroscience</mark> and <mark>network neuroscience</mark> to study <mark>brain network dynamics</mark> across diseases and disorders (main focus: <mark>multiple sclerosis</mark> and <mark>stress</mark>).

  This page is mainly intended to provide a quick overview of my shared code. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating and/or applying any code to your own research!

        description: |
          This is my preprocessing pipeline for functional and structural connectivity and network analyses using resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI.

        description: |
          This code will perform phase randomization on fourier transformed data, consistently across timeseries. This preserves static connectivity and n-lag autocorrelation, but time-dependent connectivity properties are randomized.

        link_text: Go to code
        description: |
          This code will perform community detection for multilayer connectivity matrices. The code is relatively computationally inexpensive and uses prior information on subnetwork organization to initialize/constrain the detection.
